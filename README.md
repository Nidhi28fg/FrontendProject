  </li>
<li>
  
 Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the DOM used to improve performance. React updates the Virtual DOM first, then calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM, minimising costly direct manipulations.
</li>
<li>A variable declared with `let` can be reassigned, while `const` cannot.`const` creates a read-only reference to a value, promoting immutability.</li>
<li> purpose of the `useEffect` hook is to perform side effects in functional components like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM </li>
<li>In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.</li>
